# Assignment 2: Implementation of Stacks and Queues using Linked Lists

## Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to reinforce your understanding of data structures, specifically `stacks` and `queues`, and to enhance your proficiency in implementing them using linked lists in the C programming language.

## Assignment Description:
In this assignment, you will be tasked with implementing both `stack` and `queue` data structures using `linked lists` in C. You will apply these implementations to a use case scenario: **a simplified web browser history manager**.

## Assignment Tasks:

1. **Stack Implementation**:
---

* Define a structure `StackNode` to represent each node in the linked list. This structure should contain:
    *   A pointer to a string representing the URL visited (e.g., `char* url`).
    * A pointer field to point to the next node (e.g., `struct StackNode* next`).

* Define a structure `Stack` to represent the stack itself. This structure should contain:
    * A pointer to the top node of the stack (e.g., `struct StackNode* top`).

* Implement the following functions:
    * `void push(Stack* stack, char* newUrl)`: Adds a new URL to the top of the stack.
    * `char* pop(Stack* stack)`: Removes and returns the URL from the top of the stack.
    * `char* peek(Stack* stack)`: Returns the URL from the top of the stack without removing it.
    * `bool isEmpty(Stack* stack)`: Checks if the stack is empty.

Ensure proper memory management by freeing memory for nodes that are popped from the stack.

---

2. **Queue Implementation**:

* Define a structure `QueueNode` to represent each node in the linked list. This structure should contain:
    * A pointer to a string representing the URL visited (e.g., `char* url`).
    * A pointer field to point to the next node (e.g., `struct QueueNode* next`).
* Define a structure Queue to represent the queue itself. This structure should contain:
    * Pointers to the front and rear nodes of the queue (e.g., `struct QueueNode* front`, `struct QueueNode* rear`)
* Implement the following functions:
    * `void enqueue(Queue* queue, char* newUrl)`: Adds a new URL to the rear of the queue.
    * `char* dequeue(Queue* queue)`: Removes and returns the URL from the front of the queue.
    * `char* peek(Queue* queue)`: Returns the URL from the front of the queue without removing it.
    * `bool isEmpty(Queue* queue)`: Checks if the queue is empty.
    
Ensure proper memory management by freeing memory for nodes that are dequeued from the queue.

---

3. **Web Browser History Manager**:

* Use the stack and queue implementations from Tasks 1 and 2.
* When a user visits a new web page, push the URL onto the stack and enqueue it into the queue.
* Implement a menu-based user interface allowing users to:
    1. Visit a new web page and add it to the browsing history.
    2. Navigate back to the previous web page.
    3. Navigate forward to the next web page.
    4. Display the current web page and the browsing history.
    5. Exit the browser.

Ensure that navigating back and forth updates both the stack and queue appropriately to maintain consistency in browsing history.

## **Navigating Backward and Forward**:

1. When navigating backward (using the back button), the program should pop the top URL from the stack to retrieve the previous page URL. This URL should then be displayed to the user, and it should be enqueued into the forward queue to support forward navigation.
 
2. When navigating forward (using the forward button), the program should dequeue the next URL from the queue to retrieve the next page URL. This URL should then be pushed onto the stack to support backward navigation.

---    
   
Ensure that the stack and queue are updated appropriately to maintain consistency in browsing history during navigation.

Handle edge cases such as reaching the beginning or end of the browsing history, ensuring that the user cannot navigate beyond the available pages.
